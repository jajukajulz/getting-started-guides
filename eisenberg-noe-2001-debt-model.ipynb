    "# Implementation of the Eisenberg and Noe 2001 Debt Model in Python\n",
    "# Eisenberg and Noe 2001 analyse the properties of intercorporate cash flows in financial \n",
    "# systems featuring cyclical interdependence and endogenously determined clearing vectors.\n",
    "# The model computes clearing vectors for interlinked financial systems. A clearing vector is \n",
    "# a vector of payments from nodes in the financial system to other nodes and must satisfy the \n",
    "# conditions of proportional repayments of liabilities in default (we assume all debt claims have equal priority), limited liability of equity\n",
    "# and absolute priority of debt over equity. The clearing vector is computed through a \"fictitious \n",
    "# sequential default\" algorithm in which the set of defaulting firms at the start of each round is fixed by\n",
    "# the dynamic adjustments of the system from the preceding round. In each new round,an attempt to clear the \n",
    "# system that assumes that only nodes that defaulted in the previous round default. If no new defaults occur, \n",
    "# the algorithm terminates (i.e. a node is a distincy economig entity or a financial node i.e. a firm) \n",
    "\n",
    "# This algorithm gives the clearing vector and a natural measure of systemic risk (i.e. the exposure of a given node\n",
    "# in the system to defaults by other firms - this is based on the number of waves of defaults required to \n",
    "# induce a given firm in the system to fail)\n",
